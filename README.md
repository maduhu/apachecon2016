# Cloud: Zero to Sixty

The files in this repository are the source files for the presentation I (Will Stevens) gave at ApacheCon Europe 2016.

`local_server` - These are the files which I served from my laptop during the demo.  The only two pieces which are not publicly available at the locations specified in the `scripts` is the `local_server/marvin` directory and the `local_server/macchininia` template.  Neither of these are required, but they simplify the setup of the zone, hosts, etc...

`scripts` - These are the actual scripts run in order to deploy the environments on my laptop in VMware fusion.  I have tried to keep them as realistic as possible, but please don't consider the resulting environment production ready.

`slides` - These files are the source files for my slides.  You will need `revealgo` in order to launch my slides.  For your convenience, I have included a PDF version of my slides in this repository so you don't have to go download `revealgo` if you don't want to.

I hope you enjoy.  Get in touch with me on twitter (@swillops) if you have questions or comments.  Cheers...
